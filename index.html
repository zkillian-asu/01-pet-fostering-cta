      <h2>My Home</h2>
      <p>Without Family, friends, and our core principles--whatever they may be--where might we be today?
        My home is the valley of Arizona, where the City of Mesa district sits atop a cultural history that is all but lost to fateful settlers like me, and my parents, and so on. The pursuit of truth, as well as justice, equity, and alternative thinking has led me to be skeptical of much of my suroundings. The retelling, reimiaging of facts and events has facinated me for years as well; the power of storytelling cannot be dennied. I think it is time that most people are exposed to a different kind of truth--one that emphazises humanity, our own shared creativity, and the liberties that we hold dear for ourselves and others.

      <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Life is challenging, fulfilling, and often finds us pushing ourselves in unexpected ways. In our hopes and dreams, we are filling buckets which we run to our souls.  Buckets which are, in essence, everything we desire. We tote the buckets in our dreams each night, picking up speed. We run perfectly, so perfectly our calves tighten.
        We run so perfeclty, we gasp ourselves awake and learn to hate the blunder and dreadful spill.
      But we can't be afraid--we must untrain and accept that we are stepping in puddles everyday.  Every day we are doing our best to smile through the cold and push back.  Puddles dry, seasons change.   </p>
